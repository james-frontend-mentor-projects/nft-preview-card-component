## My process

I normally get stuck in to these challenges with frontend frameworks and/or CSS preprocessors or frameworks. For this challenge I decided to just use pure CSS and HTML, since recently I feel I have really been ignoring basic HTML/CSS principles and I don't want to lose sight of my fundamentals. So... here's a bare-bones project! I coded this up in the latter half of an afternoon and would like to revisit it after getting some feedback on my semantic HTML and CSS styles.
